DIP THEORY

Practical 1
üîç Aim:
To perform 2D Linear Convolution and 2D Circular Convolution between two 2D matrices.

‚úÖ PART 1: 2D LINEAR CONVOLUTION
üî¢ Example 1:
matlab
CopyEdit
clc;
pramod37_x = [4,5,6;7,8,9];
pramod37_h = [1;1;1];
disp(pramod37_x,"pramod37_x=")
disp(pramod37_h,"pramod37_h=")
pramod37_y = conv2(pramod37_x, pramod37_h);
disp(pramod37_y,"2D Linear Convolution result: y=")
üß† Explanation:
pramod37_x is a 2x3 matrix (image or signal).
pramod37_h is a 3x1 matrix (kernel/filter).
conv2(x,h) performs 2D convolution.
It slides the filter over the matrix and performs multiplication + summation (dot product).
The output will be size: (2+3-1) x (3+1-1) = 4x3.
This is also called full convolution.

üî¢ Example 2:
matlab
CopyEdit
clc;
pramod37_x = [1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9];
pramod37_h = [1,1;1,1;1,1];
disp(pramod37_x,"pramod37_x=")
disp(pramod37_h,"pramod37_h=")
pramod37_y = conv2(pramod37_x, pramod37_h);
disp(pramod37_y,"2D Linear Convolution result: y=")
pramod37_x is 3x3, and pramod37_h is 3x2.
Output size will be: (3+3‚àí1) x (3+2‚àí1) = 5x4

‚úÖ PART 2: 2D CIRCULAR CONVOLUTION
üìå Theory:
Circular convolution uses the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
Convolution in time/spatial domain is equivalent to multiplication in frequency domain.
In MATLAB, we use fft2 for 2D FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), and ifft2 for inverse.

üî¢ Example 1:
matlab
CopyEdit
clc;
pramod37_x = [1,2;3,4];
pramod37_h = [5,6;7,8];
disp(pramod37_x,"pramod37_x=")
disp(pramod37_h,"pramod37_h=")
pramod37_X = fft2(pramod37_x);
pramod37_H = fft2(pramod37_h);
Y = pramod37_X .* pramod37_H;
pramod37_y = ifft2(Y);
disp(pramod37_y,"2D Circular Convolution result: y=")
üß† Explanation:
fft2(x) ‚Üí converts to frequency domain.
Multiply both transforms.
ifft2(Y) ‚Üí convert back to spatial domain.
This gives circular convolution result (size is same as input).

üî¢ Example 2:
matlab
CopyEdit
clc;
pramod37_x = [1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9];
pramod37_h = [1,1,1;1,1,1;1,1,1];
...
Again, same steps as above but with 3x3 matrices.
Result is also 3x3 due to circular nature.

üë®‚Äçüè´ How to Explain to Invigilator:
‚ÄúIn this practical, we demonstrate two types of 2D convolution operations. First, linear convolution, which gives a bigger output by sliding the filter across the matrix. Second, circular convolution, which uses Fourier Transform where convolution becomes multiplication in frequency domain, and the result size is same as input. We use conv2() for linear, and fft2() with ifft2() for circular convolution.‚Äù

What does conv2() do in MATLAB?	It performs 2D linear convolution between two matrices.
What is fft2() and ifft2()?	fft2() computes the 2D Fourier transform, and ifft2() computes its inverse. They‚Äôre used in circular convolution.
Why is convolution used in image processing?	It's used for filtering, blurring, edge detection, sharpening, etc.
What is the output size of 2D linear convolution?	If input size is m√ón and filter size is p√óq, output size is (m+p-1) √ó (n+q-1).
Which is faster: linear or circular convolution?	Circular convolution via FFT is usually faster for large matrices.

Practical 2
Aim
To express Circular Convolution as Linear Convolution + Aliasing using 2D matrices in MATLAB.

üß† Concept Overview
üîÅ Circular Convolution:
Circular convolution wraps around the matrix edges.
It is periodic and results in output size = size of input.
‚ûï Linear Convolution + Aliasing:
When performing linear convolution, we get a larger output.
But circular convolution assumes periodic extension, so extra rows/columns from linear convolution overlap back (aliasing) into the original matrix size.
üëâ This practical demonstrates how circular convolution can be simulated by:
Performing linear convolution.
Folding (aliasing) the overflow parts back into the original size.

üß™ MATLAB Code Explained
üî¢ Code:
matlab
CopyEdit
clc;
pramod_x = [1,2;3,4];          % Input matrix
pramod_h = [5,6;7,8];          % Filter matrix

pramod_y = conv2(pramod_x, pramod_h);     % 2D Linear Convolution (gives 3x3 matrix)

% Wrap-around (aliasing) on columns
pramod_y1 = [pramod_y(:,1) + pramod_y(:,3), pramod_y(:,2)];

% Wrap-around (aliasing) on rows
pramod_y2 = [pramod_y1(1,:) + pramod_y1(3,:); pramod_y1(2,:)];

% Display results
disp(pramod_y, "Pramod Joshi 248637 Linear Convolution Result: y=");
disp(pramod_y2, "Circular Convolution expressed as Linear Convolution=");

üìä Step-by-step Explanation:
1. Linear Convolution:
You get a 3√ó3 matrix from conv2() since:
Input size: 2√ó2
Filter size: 2√ó2
Output size: (2+2‚àí1) √ó (2+2‚àí1) = 3√ó3
Let‚Äôs say output is:
ini
CopyEdit
y = [5   16   12;
     22  60   40;
     21  52   32];
2. Aliasing Columns:
matlab
CopyEdit
pramod_y1 = [pramod_y(:,1) + pramod_y(:,3), pramod_y(:,2)];
This folds the 1st and 3rd columns together (wrap around) ‚Üí simulating periodic boundary.
3. Aliasing Rows:
matlab
CopyEdit
pramod_y2 = [pramod_y1(1,:) + pramod_y1(3,:); pramod_y1(2,:)];
This adds the 1st and 3rd rows together ‚Üí simulating circular convolution.
4. Result:
Final matrix pramod_y2 is of size 2x2, which is the same size as the inputs.
This simulates circular convolution using linear convolution + aliasing.

üìò How to Explain to Invigilator:
"In this practical, we take two 2√ó2 matrices and perform 2D linear convolution using conv2(). This gives a 3√ó3 output. Since circular convolution must have the same size as the inputs (2√ó2), we simulate circular convolution by folding the extra rows and columns back into the result using aliasing. This shows that circular convolution can be expressed as linear convolution plus aliasing (wrapping around overflow terms)."

üîÅ What is Correlation?
Correlation is a measure of similarity between two signals (or matrices).
Cross-Correlation ‚Üí Compares two different signals.
Auto-Correlation ‚Üí Compares a signal with itself.
Convolution vs Correlation ‚Üí Correlation is like convolution without flipping the kernel (but in MATLAB, we simulate correlation using convolution after flipping the kernel manually).

üî∑ A) Linear Cross Correlation
üî¢ Code:
matlab
CopyEdit
clc;
pramod_x = [3,1;2,4];                  % Input matrix
pramod_h1 = [1,5;2,3];                 % Correlation kernel

% Flip the kernel both horizontally and vertically to simulate correlation using convolution
pramod_h2 = pramod_h1(:, end:-1:1);    
pramod_h = pramod_h2(end:-1:1, :);     

pramod_y = conv2(pramod_x, pramod_h);  % Perform linear correlation
disp(pramod_y, "linear Cross Correlation result y=");
üìò Explanation:
conv2() performs convolution, but for correlation, we flip the filter (kernel) before applying it.
(:, end:-1:1) flips columns (horizontal flip), and end:-1:1, : flips rows (vertical flip).
Output shows how well pramod_x and pramod_h1 match at different positions.

üî∑ B) Circular Cross Correlation
üî¢ Code:
matlab
CopyEdit
clc;
pramod_x = [1,5;2,4];
pramod_h = [3,2;4,1];

% Flip the kernel
pramod_h = pramod_h(:, end:-1:1);
pramod_h = pramod_h(end:-1:1, :);

% Apply FFT-based circular correlation
pramod_X = fft2(pramod_x);
pramod_H = fft2(pramod_h);
pramod_Y = pramod_X .* pramod_H;
pramod_y = ifft2(pramod_Y);

disp(pramod_y, "Pramod 248637 Circular Correlation result y=");
üìò Explanation:
Uses 2D FFT to convert both input and flipped kernel into frequency domain.
Multiplies them and applies ifft2 to get result.
Because it's circular, size remains same as input.
You simulate correlation by flipping pramod_h before FFT.

üî∑ C) Linear Auto Correlation
üî¢ Code:
matlab
CopyEdit
clc;
pramod_x1 = [1,1;1,1];

% Flip the same matrix to auto-correlate
pramod_x2 = pramod_x1(:, end:-1:1);

pramod_x = conv2(pramod_x1, pramod_x2);   % Perform linear auto-correlation
disp(pramod_x, "Pramod 248637 linear auto Correlation x=");
üìò Explanation:
Auto-correlation means comparing the signal with itself.
The second version is flipped to simulate correlation.
Output gives a measure of how much a signal correlates with a shifted version of itself.

pramod_y = conv2(pramod_x, pramod_h);
disp(pramod_y, "Pramod 248637 linear Cross Correlation result y=");
üìò Explanation:

Repeats the flipping and convolution logic to simulate correlation.

Prac4
‚úÖ Aim:
To perform the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a 4x4 grayscale image using MATLAB.

üî¢ Code:
matlab
CopyEdit
clc;
x = [1,1,1,1; 
     1,1,1,1; 
     1,1,1,1; 
     1,1,1,1];

X = fft2(x, -1);     % Perform 2D DFT
disp(X, "X[k]=");
üîÅ You may have a typo in your code. It should be fft2(x) instead of fft(x,-1) for 2D DFT on an image.

üß† Theory Behind the Code
üìò What is DFT?
The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) converts a signal (or image) from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.
In the frequency domain, we can analyze patterns, periodicity, and frequency content of the image.
üñºÔ∏è In context of an image:
Each pixel represents intensity in the spatial domain.
Applying DFT helps us see how the image is composed of different frequency components (low, mid, high).

‚öôÔ∏è Explanation of Code
x = [1,1,1,1; ... ]
This is a 4√ó4 grayscale image, where all pixel values are 1 (uniform image).
X = fft2(x)
fft2 is used for 2D DFT, commonly used in image processing.
It converts the 2D image into its frequency representation.
disp(X)
Displays the output of DFT.
Since all pixels are the same (1), the result will show:
One non-zero frequency component (DC component), and
All other frequency components as zero.

üß™ Expected Output
For a 4x4 matrix filled with 1s, the output of fft2(x) will be:
matlab
CopyEdit
X =
    16     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0
‚ú® Why?
Because the image is completely uniform.
So the only frequency present is the DC component (X(1,1) = 16, which is the sum of all pixel values).
All other frequencies are zero (no changes in intensity across rows or columns).

üë®‚Äçüè´ How to Explain to Invigilator:
"In this practical, we create a 4x4 grayscale image with all pixels having value 1. We apply 2D DFT using the fft2() function. Since the image is uniform, its frequency spectrum will contain only the DC component, which is the total energy of the image (1√ó16 = 16). The rest of the frequencies will be zero because there are no changes or patterns in the image. This shows that DFT captures how fast intensities change across an image."

Question	Answer
What is DFT?	DFT stands for Discrete Fourier Transform. It converts a signal/image from the time/spatial domain into the frequency domain.
Why use DFT in image processing?	To analyze the frequency content of an image, perform filtering, compression, and feature extraction.
What is the difference between fft() and fft2()?	fft() is for 1D signals, while fft2() is for 2D matrices like images.
What does fft2(x) return?	It returns the 2D Fourier transform of matrix x, showing frequency components.
What is the value of X(1,1) in DFT?	It is the DC component, which represents the average or total intensity (sum of all pixels).
What is the output of fft2() for a uniform image?	The DC component is non-zero; all other frequency components are zero.
What is the inverse of DFT?	Inverse DFT (IDFT) is used to convert data back to the spatial domain. In MATLAB, use ifft2().
Is DFT output complex?	Yes, the DFT output is usually complex, containing both magnitude and phase.
How do you visualize DFT of an image?	Use abs(fft2(x)) to get magnitude spectrum and angle(fft2(x)) for phase.

X = [4,3,5,6;
     4,2,7,7;
     5,5,6,7];
[m,n] = size(X);
A = [];
E = [];
üß† Step-by-step Logic:

üìå Step 1: Compute Mean and Covariance Matrix
matlab
CopyEdit
for i = 1:n
    A = A + X(:,i);               % Sum of each column vector (for mean)
    E = E + X(:,i) * X(:,i)';     % Outer product for Covariance calculation
end

mx = A / n;       % Mean vector
E = E / n;        % Mean of the outer products
C = E - mx * mx'; % Covariance Matrix
A accumulates all columns ‚Üí to compute mean.
E accumulates outer products ‚Üí to compute covariance.
C is the covariance matrix of the data.

üìå Step 2: Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
matlab
CopyEdit
[V,D] = spec(C);       % Eigen decomposition
d = diag(D);           % Eigenvalues
[d, i] = gsort(d);     % Sort eigenvalues descending
spec(C) gives eigenvalues D and eigenvectors V.
gsort(d) sorts eigenvalues from largest to smallest (for energy order).

üìå Step 3: Sort Eigenvectors Accordingly
matlab
CopyEdit
for j = 1:length(d)
    T(:,j) = V(:,i(j));   % Sorted Eigenvectors
end
T = T';
T becomes the transformation matrix (eigenvectors arranged by importance).
Each row of T is a basis vector in KL space.

üìå Step 4: KL Transformation (Projection)
matlab
CopyEdit
for i = 1:n
    Y(:,i) = T * X(:,i);  % Project X onto KL basis
end
disp(Y, 'KL transformation of the input matrix Y=')
Projects original data onto KL basis ‚Üí this is the KL Transformed Data Y.

üìå Step 5: Reconstruction
matlab
CopyEdit
for i = 1:n
    x(:,i) = T' * Y(:,i);  % Reconstruct original data
end
disp(x, 'Reconstructed matrix of the given sample matrix X=')
By multiplying with T', you can reconstruct the original matrix X.

üë®‚Äçüè´ How to Explain to Invigilator
"In this practical, we perform the KL transform (also known as PCA for 2D matrices). We start with a 3√ó4 matrix X. First, we compute the mean and the covariance matrix. Then we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, which give us the KL transform basis. We sort the eigenvectors based on eigenvalues and use them as our transformation matrix T. The KL transform of X is obtained by projecting X onto these basis vectors. Finally, we reconstruct the original matrix using the inverse transform. This is useful in image compression and pattern recognition, where we want to reduce redundancy and keep important information."

üîç 1. Brightness Enhancement
üß† Concept:
Brightness is related to how light or dark an image is. By increasing or decreasing the intensity values of each pixel, we can brighten or darken an image.
‚öôÔ∏è What Happens in the Code:

Brightness is increased by adding a constant value (e.g., 50) to all pixel intensities.
A darker version is also created by subtracting the same constant.

"We enhance the brightness by increasing each pixel‚Äôs intensity by 50. This makes the image appear lighter. Similarly, decreasing intensity darkens the image. We ensure the result stays in valid image format by converting it back to uint8 after modification."

üéØ 2. Contrast Manipulation
üß† Concept:
Contrast refers to the difference between the darkest and brightest parts of the image. Higher contrast makes features more distinct, while lower contrast makes it look dull.
‚öôÔ∏è What Happens in the Code:
Pixel values are multiplied:
0.5 √ó pixel value ‚Üí Decreases contrast
2 √ó pixel value (after reduction) ‚Üí Increases contrast
‚úÖ What to Explain to Invigilator:
"In this part, we modify the contrast by scaling the pixel intensities. Reducing all pixel values compresses the intensity range (low contrast), while stretching them back increases it. This simulates how image contrast can be controlled."

üåì 3. Image Negative
üß† Concept:
Negative images invert brightness ‚Äì dark areas become light and light areas become dark. This is useful in medical imaging and feature detection.
‚öôÔ∏è What Happens in the Code:
Every pixel intensity is subtracted from 255 (the maximum for 8-bit images).
This flips the brightness scale:
New Pixel = 255 - Old Pixel
‚úÖ What to Explain to Invigilator:
"To create the negative, we subtract each pixel from 255. This inverts the image ‚Äì dark regions become bright and vice versa. This technique is helpful in highlighting features that are not easily visible in the original image."

üéì Viva Questions and Answers
Viva Question	Answer
What is brightness in an image?	Brightness refers to how light or dark an image is, controlled by pixel intensity values.
How is brightness increased or decreased?	By adding or subtracting a constant value to/from each pixel‚Äôs intensity.
What is contrast?	Contrast is the difference in intensity between the darkest and brightest parts of the image.
How do you increase contrast?	By multiplying pixel values to stretch the intensity range.
What happens if pixel values go beyond 255?	They are clipped back to 255 if not handled properly. That's why we convert back to uint8.
What is the purpose of image negative?	To invert the brightness levels, often used in X-rays and other medical images for better analysis.
Why convert images to grayscale first?	Grayscale simplifies processing by reducing the image to one channel of intensity values.
What is the pixel range of grayscale image?	0 to 255 for 8-bit images.
What is the datatype of images in Scilab/Matlab?	Typically uint8 for standard images, which stores values from 0 to 255.
Why use double() before operations?	To avoid overflow/underflow during mathematical operations.

‚úÖ Aim:
To perform Thresholding Operation and Gray Level Slicing on a grayscale image using Scilab.

üîç 1. Threshold Operation
üß† Concept:
Thresholding is a segmentation technique used to convert a grayscale image into a binary image. It is widely used in separating objects from the background.
‚öôÔ∏è What Happens in the Code:
The input image is converted to grayscale.
A threshold value t is taken as input.
The program checks each pixel:
If pixel intensity < t ‚Üí set to 0 (black).
Else ‚Üí set to 255 (white).
The result is a binary image highlighting areas above and below the threshold.
‚úÖ What to Say to Invigilator:
"In thresholding, we compare each pixel with a threshold value. If it's less than the threshold, we set it to black (0), otherwise to white (255). This creates a binary image, helping in object detection, like identifying text or shapes."

üéØ 2. Gray Level Slicing
üß† Concept:
Gray level slicing is used to highlight a specific range of intensities (gray levels) in an image. It‚Äôs useful in medical and satellite images where you want to enhance certain features.
‚öôÔ∏è What Happens in the Code:
The image is converted to grayscale and typecast to double for processing.
The maximum pixel intensity L is calculated.
A slicing range is selected from a = L/2 to b = L.
Each pixel is checked:
If it falls within [a, b], set to maximum intensity (highlighted).
Else, set to 0 (black).
The resulting image shows only the region of interest in white.
‚úÖ What to Say to Invigilator:
"In gray level slicing, we isolate a specific range of pixel values and make them white (highlight), setting all others to black. It helps bring out regions of interest without preserving the background."

üß† Viva Questions & Answers

üß™ Aim:
To study image segmentation techniques using:
Differentiation of Gaussian (DoG) function
DoG filter function
Edge detection with different operators

üß© Part A: Differentiation of Gaussian Function
‚úÖ Concept:
The Gaussian function smooths an image (reduces noise).
The Differentiation of Gaussian (DoG) is the second derivative of the Gaussian.
It helps in detecting edges by identifying areas where intensity changes rapidly.
üîç Explanation of Code Steps:
You input a value for œÉ (sigma) ‚Äì which controls the smoothness.
A range -10 to 10 is created to simulate 1D space.
The DoG formula is applied to generate a curve.
This curve shows where edges would be strongest in a real image.
üéØ What to tell Invigilator:
"We take the second derivative of the Gaussian function to highlight areas in the image where intensity changes quickly, which is useful for edge detection. The shape of the function is like a wave ‚Äî it goes up, then down ‚Äî capturing transitions in pixel values."

üß© Part B: DoG Filter Function
‚úÖ Concept:
This simulates Difference of Gaussians using two different sigma values.
It acts like a band-pass filter, enhancing features within a specific frequency range.
üîç Explanation of Code Steps:
You input two sigma values, œÉ1 and œÉ2.
Two Gaussian derivatives are calculated using these sigmas.
Subtracting the two results gives a DoG filter curve.
This visually shows how feature enhancement or edge detection can change depending on the sigma values.
üéØ What to tell Invigilator:
"Here we subtract two Gaussian derivatives with different sigma values. This is called the Difference of Gaussians. It emphasizes edges more clearly and can be used for detecting structures of specific sizes in images."

üß© Part C: Edge Detection using Operators
‚úÖ Concept:
This part uses 4 standard edge detection algorithms:
Sobel
Prewitt
LoG (Laplacian of Gaussian)
Canny
üîç Explanation of Code Steps:
The original image is converted to grayscale for simplicity.
The edge() function is applied using each method:
Sobel: Detects edges using a horizontal and vertical mask.
Prewitt: Similar to Sobel but uses a simpler averaging kernel.
LoG: Combines Gaussian smoothing and Laplacian edge detection.
Canny: Most advanced ‚Äî uses gradient calculation + non-maximum suppression + double thresholding.
Each result is displayed in a separate figure.
üéØ What to tell Invigilator:
"We apply multiple edge detection algorithms to compare their effectiveness. Sobel and Prewitt detect basic vertical and horizontal edges. LoG uses smoothing before detecting changes, and Canny is more precise and accurate, detecting even faint edges with better noise suppression."

üß† Viva Questions & Answers
Question	Answer
What is image segmentation?	It is the process of dividing an image into meaningful regions or objects for easier analysis.
What is the role of sigma in Gaussian?	Sigma controls the spread of the Gaussian. Higher sigma means more smoothing.
Why do we use DoG?	It enhances edges and features by subtracting Gaussian-blurred images with different sigmas.
What is the main difference between Sobel and Prewitt?	Sobel gives more weight to center pixels, making it slightly more accurate than Prewitt.
What is the best edge detector?	Canny is considered the best because it‚Äôs accurate, detects weak edges, and reduces noise.
What is LoG in edge detection?	LoG stands for Laplacian of Gaussian. It first smooths the image with a Gaussian and then applies a Laplacian filter.
What happens if sigma is too low or too high?	Too low = less smoothing (noise preserved), Too high = oversmoothing (edges may be lost).
Why convert image to grayscale?	Edge detection works on intensity values, which are present in grayscale images.

üß™ Aim:
To implement a simple image compression technique using block-wise processing, mean, standard deviation, and binary thresholding.

üìå What This Practical Does (Summary):
This practical:
Takes a 4√ó4 matrix as an image block (gray values).
Divides it into smaller sub-blocks (user-defined size).
Computes mean and standard deviation for each block.
Uses this info to create a binary allocation matrix.
Based on that, calculates two representative values: a (low) and b (high).
Replaces block values using only a and b ‚Üí this compresses the block.

üß© Main Concepts Explained:
‚úÖ 1. Block Division
The image is divided into blk x blk sub-blocks.
This allows processing in small chunks ‚Üí like JPEG does in 8x8 blocks.

‚úÖ 2. Mean (m) and Standard Deviation (œÉ)
Mean (m): Average pixel intensity in the block.
Standard Deviation (œÉ): How much pixel values vary from the mean.
Used to estimate brightness and contrast in that block.

‚úÖ 3. Binary Allocation Matrix (B)
Compares each pixel in the block with the mean:
If pixel > mean ‚Üí 1
Else ‚Üí 0
Result is a binary matrix of the same block size.
This helps identify which pixels are ‚Äúbrighter‚Äù than average.

‚úÖ 4. Values a and b (ml and mu)
These are the two pixel values we will keep for compression.
ml (low value) = for 0s in B (darker pixels)
mu (high value) = for 1s in B (brighter pixels)
These are computed using the mean, standard deviation, and ratio of 1s/0s in B.
This helps recreate the block using only 2 values instead of many.

‚úÖ 5. Reconstruction
Replace every 1 in B with mu, every 0 with ml.
That gives a compressed approximation of the original block.
So now, each block is represented with just two intensity levels instead of all the original values.

üß† How to Explain to Invigilator:
"We divide the image matrix into smaller blocks and compress each block using only two values: one for the brighter pixels and one for the darker pixels. These values are calculated using the block's mean and standard deviation. The binary matrix helps us identify which pixel gets which value. This helps us reduce data and is a basic form of image compression."

üí¨ Viva Questions and Answers
Question	Answer
What is image compression?	Reducing the amount of data needed to represent an image without significantly affecting its quality.
Why use blocks in compression?	Processing smaller blocks reduces complexity and helps preserve local features, similar to JPEG compression.
What is the role of the mean in this practical?	It's used as a threshold to separate bright and dark pixels.
What is the use of the binary matrix B?	It marks which pixels are above (1) or below (0) the mean, used to reconstruct the image with fewer values.
Why do we use only two values (a and b)?	To reduce the data size ‚Äî it's a form of lossy compression using just two intensity levels per block.
What happens if all values are above or below the mean?	No compression is applied ‚Äî we skip that block because it already has uniform intensity.
Is this lossless or lossy compression?	Lossy ‚Äî because we lose the exact original pixel values and use approximated ones.
Can we improve this method?	Yes, by using more levels or adaptive block sizes or transform-based methods like DCT.

üß™ Aim:
To perform:
Binary Image Processing ‚Äì using dilation, erosion, opening, and closing
Color Image Processing ‚Äì extracting and modifying RGB components of a color image

üß© 1. Dilation and Erosion (Binary Image Processing)
‚úÖ What is Dilation?
Dilation expands white regions in a binary image.
Useful to fill gaps, connect objects, or make shapes thicker.
It adds pixels to object boundaries.
‚úÖ What is Erosion?
Erosion shrinks white regions.
Useful to remove noise or disconnect objects.
It removes pixels from object boundaries.
‚úÖ What is the structuring element?
A small shape (like a 7√ó7 rectangle here) used to define how the operation is applied.
Acts like a kernel or mask.
‚úÖ Explanation:
You read an image (usually a binary or grayscale).
Apply imdilate() and imerode() with the structuring element.
Show the result using imshow().

üß© 2. Opening and Closing (Morphological Operations)
‚úÖ What is Opening?
Erosion followed by Dilation.
Removes small white noise or thin protrusions.
Good for smoothing object contours.
‚úÖ What is Closing?
Dilation followed by Erosion.
Fills small black holes or gaps inside objects.
Good for joining broken parts of an object.
‚úÖ Explanation:
Image is processed using imopen() and imclose() with a structuring element.
The result is smoother and cleaner objects.

üß© 3. Extracting RGB Components (Color Image Processing)
‚úÖ How does an RGB image work?
A color image is made of Red, Green, and Blue channels, each 2D matrix of pixel values.
These are stacked into a 3D matrix (height √ó width √ó 3).
‚úÖ Component Extraction:
To isolate one color:
Set the other two channels to zero.
For example:
To show only Red, set Green and Blue to 0.
This helps you visualize individual color contributions.

üß© 4. Removing RGB Planes (Color Separation)
‚úÖ Concept:
Instead of showing only one component, this shows how the image looks when one color component is removed.
This affects the overall image color:
Removing red makes the image appear bluish-green, and so on.
‚úÖ Why is it useful?
Helps in understanding how each component affects the final image.
Important in color correction and processing tasks.

üß† How to Explain to Invigilator:
"In the first part, we apply morphological operations like dilation and erosion to enhance or clean up binary images. Dilation expands objects, and erosion shrinks them. We also use opening and closing to remove noise and fill small gaps. In the second part, we work with RGB images. We isolate each color component to understand its contribution, and also observe the effect of removing any one component from the image."

üß™ Aim:
To perform image arithmetic operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
on two images.

üîç What is Image Arithmetic?
Image arithmetic involves performing mathematical operations pixel-by-pixel on two images of the same size. It is useful in:
Enhancing or comparing images
Removing background or noise
Masking parts of images
Creating special effects

üìå Main Points for Each Operation:

üü¢ 1. Image Addition
What it does:
Adds the pixel values of two images.
c(i,j)=a(i,j)+b(i,j)c(i,j) = a(i,j) + b(i,j)c(i,j)=a(i,j)+b(i,j) 
Use cases:
Brighten an image
Combine details from two different sources (e.g., CT + MRI)
Create overlay effects
Important step:
Both images must be resized to the same dimensions.

üî¥ 2. Image Subtraction
What it does:
Subtracts one image from another:
c(i,j)=a(i,j)‚àíb(i,j)c(i,j) = a(i,j) - b(i,j)c(i,j)=a(i,j)‚àíb(i,j) 
Use cases:
Background subtraction
Motion detection
Spotting differences between two frames or images
Note:
Negative pixel values may get clipped to 0 (black), depending on data type.

üîµ 3. Image Multiplication
What it does:
Multiplies the corresponding pixels of two images:
c(i,j)=a(i,j)√ób(i,j)c(i,j) = a(i,j) \times b(i,j)c(i,j)=a(i,j)√ób(i,j) 
Use cases:
Masking: multiply with a binary mask
Enhancing certain regions
Pixel-wise blending
Caution:
Result can go beyond the 0‚Äì255 range, so image might appear too bright or dark if not normalized.

üü£ 4. Image Division
What it does:
Divides pixels of one image by another:
c(i,j)=a(i,j)b(i,j)c(i,j) = \frac{a(i,j)}{b(i,j)}c(i,j)=b(i,j)a(i,j)‚Äã 
Use cases:
Normalize an image
Compare intensities
Highlight structural differences
Important:
Handle division by zero (black pixels = 0) ‚Äî this can create errors or undefined pixels.

üí¨ How to Explain to Invigilator:
"In this practical, we performed basic arithmetic operations on images. We first resize both images to the same size to ensure pixel-by-pixel operations work correctly. Then we applied addition to enhance brightness or combine details, subtraction to detect differences, multiplication to mask or emphasize parts, and division to compare or normalize intensity values. These operations are common in preprocessing and analysis in medical imaging, object tracking, and satellite image analysis."

üß† Viva Questions and Answers
Question	Answer
Why do we resize images before arithmetic operations?	To ensure both images are of the same size, so pixel-wise operations can be performed.
What is the use of image addition?	To brighten an image, blend two images, or highlight features.
What is image subtraction used for?	To detect changes, perform background removal, or compare two images.
What is the risk in image multiplication?	Pixel values may exceed 255, leading to overflow or display distortion.
What is the main concern in image division?	Division by zero, which can lead to undefined or noisy output.
